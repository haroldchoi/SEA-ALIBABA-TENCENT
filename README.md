# Stock-price-analysis
#### Using Python I undercover the performance of four tech giants in SouthEast Asia and China, namely SEA Limited, Alibaba Group Holding, Tencent Holdings and NetEase Inc,  competitors in the area of ecommerce, internet and technology platform services and are listed on the NYSE. 

#### Using sharpe ratio and standard deviation, I evaluate the stock price and excess return of SEA, ALIBABA and TENCENT. In addition, the S&P500 was used as a benchmark for the performance of the three companies' stock price and thereafter a set of recommendation to conclude which is the best performing stock.
